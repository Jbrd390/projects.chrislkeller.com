### ft-to-highcharts-chart

Further stripping down the [Fusion-Tables-To-Highcharts project](https://github.com/chrislkeller/Fusion-Tables-To-Highcharts), this uses [Google Fusion Tables](http://www.google.com/fusiontables/) as a data backend to draw a chart that uses the [Highcharts.js](http://www.highcharts.com/) library.

Unlike the previous project, this doesn't include a map, and therefore isn't relying on a click event to draw the chart.
