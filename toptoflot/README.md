#topToflot

This takes a google spreadsheet and ties it to a [flot] (http://www.flotcharts.org/) chart. [Tabletop] (https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) ties them together. 

If you already have tabletop.js, flot.js and jquery.js somewhere on your servers the only js file you'll need is topToflot.js.
