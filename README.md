#### Repository for [projects.chrislkeller.com](http://projects.chrislkeller.com)

In the past I had GitHub repos all over the place for simple one-off practice projects and practice demos that I had worked on, fooled around with or hacked together.

I decided to consolidate them all into one repo to save myself some headaches and to make updating, maintaining and deploying them a much simpler process.
