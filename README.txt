<p>The idea of taking short fiction and opening it up for others to add to, subtract from or branch out into new directions is intriguing to me.</p>
<p>So I present to you the GitHub repo for <a href="https://github.com/chrislkeller/Everyone-Else-Was-Driving" target="_blank">Everyone Else Was Driving</a>, a short story I wrote back in 2002. There's a passage from the story below.</p>
<p>I haven't looked at this for at least seven years, and right now I wonder if it's something that could be said to have a beginning, a middle and an end.</p>
<p>So there it is, in all its mediocre (being generous) glory. Fork away.</p>
<p>And as unplausible as the story might be, the idea of someone looking for a connection in this world remains a constant, at least in my mind. So I think it has legs...</p>
