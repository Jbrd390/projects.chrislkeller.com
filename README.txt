Is it possible to use version control and fork short fiction? Let's find out...

Apologies in advance if this misuses GitHub, but the idea of taking short fiction and opening it up to people to add to, subtract from or branch out is intriguing to me.

I write this short piece back in 2002. I haven't looked at it since at least 2004, so it's there in all it's mediocre (being generous) glory.

And as unplausible as the story might be, the idea of someone looking for a connection in this world remains a constant, at least in my mind.
