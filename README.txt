This map of Knight Mozilla News Lab participants uses Fusion Tables as a backend database and the Google Maps js API.

I added loco scripts for the browser and smart phone, as well as ios meta declarations so that this could become a web app without much work at all. It got too late in the night for me to figure out how the map might fit into things... Now that I think of it, might be slick to just have a random mojonewslab profile pop up?
