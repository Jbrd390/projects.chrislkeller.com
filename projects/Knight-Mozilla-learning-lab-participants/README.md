### Knight-Mozilla-learning-lab-participants

This map of Knight Mozilla News Lab participants uses Fusion Tables as a backend database and the Google Maps js API.

It is an iteration from a couple maps out there, adding the ability to search across a participants interests if they have added any to their profiles.

Then my appetite got the best of me for a bit before I pushed away from the table.

So you will find js functions -- mimicked and crude as they may be -- for detecting whether the browser is a smartphone, the W3C loco (geolocation) API, and meta tags for an ios startup screen, home screen icon and full-screen mobile web app.

Have fun creating, and any feedback on how to do things more efficiently in js is always welcome. And one day, I will learn jQuery.
