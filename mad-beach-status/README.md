# mad-beach-status

Hacked-together attempt at a Python scraper of Madison, Wis. beach status using Beautiful Soup and Requests. It pulls similar data from the Madison and Dane County Public Health website.

This could be made better in a number of ways. Two that come to mind:

- Display lake that the beach is on
- if else for when beach is monitored by another agency and no status is available
